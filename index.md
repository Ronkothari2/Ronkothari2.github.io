### CPSC 120

Lab 4: All of lab 4 is one of my favorute labs because it was the first lab where I felt 
like I coukd understand what was truly going on and felt like I could really help which was nice

Lab 6: Although I found it kinda challenging it was very satifying when we finished it and also blackjack 
is one of the few card games that I know so I was looking forward to trying to code something related to it

Lab 8: I'm not going to lie the only reason I liked this lab is because it wasn't that long and my partner said he 
wouldn't be able to help for a couple days because of personal reasons so I knew I had to step up and I think I did
decent job. These labs are my favoirte becasue these are the ones where I really felt accomplished
